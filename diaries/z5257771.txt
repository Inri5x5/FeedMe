Week 1
During our lab time, we formed our groups and explored which project we wanted to complete. 
By the end of week 1 we finalised our decision on a recipe reccomendation system and assigned each member a set of user stories to write.

Week 2
During our lab this week, we discussed the user stories we were set to write and started mapping out the flow chart.
By the end of the week, I had finished researching and witing the project background (problem statement + existing solutions).
The team also collaborated and agreed upon a flow chart. From this, we split up which story boards to complete for out lab meeting next week. 

Week 3
During our lab this week, we brainstormed a different novel idea (linking demonstration videos to recipes) and discussed our tech stack.
Throughout the week, we worked on the project proposal. I mainly worked on the background.
We met on Saturday to consolidate our work - we made adjustments to the flow diagram and storyboards.
On Sunday finalisations to the storyboards were complete meaning I could finalise the flow chart and put them into the project proposal.
We submitted the proposal Sunday night!

Week 4
Today during the lab, I started my setup which took longer than expected.
